# project description M320

In this project we have the free choice of what to do. We can do this project in one or two groups. We have decided to program a hospital managing system with python. We want to focus on object oriented programming but also apply some machine learning for our data.

**Requirements:**
- OOP 
- Build in interfaces

*Further requirements follow.*

**idea:**
We want to make a hospital managing system to help track health data or make it easier for users to do their job better. We got some inspiration from the internet and came up with this idea. But of course we want to make it better than the examples you can find on the internet.

We want to include many useful features and also design a nice user friendly GUI.


**in addition:**
At the end, if we still have time, we would like to use our data for machine learning to perform some interesting data analysis.
