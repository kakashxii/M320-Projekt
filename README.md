# project description M320

In this project we have the free choice of what to do. We can do this project in one or two groups. We have decided to program a school management system with python. We want to focus on object oriented programming but also apply some machine learning for our data.

**Requirements:**
- OOP 
- Build in interfaces
- Console application

*Further requirements follow.*

**idea:**
We would like to make a school management system to manage the data of a fictitious school. The user can search, delete or also update students or teachers. We have used an example from this site ([link to the example](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/student-management-system-in-python/))as a guide.

We decided to make a simple console application that is easy and understandable for any user. Also we introduce a help function that can be helpful in using the app.

Of course, our goal is not to copy this code, it is just for inspiration and as a small support in the project. Additionally we would like to add a class for unittests if there is time.


**in addition:**
At the end, if we still have time, we would like to use our data for machine learning to perform some interesting data analysis.
